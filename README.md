## IMPLEMENTATION OF BOTTLENECK NON CROSS MATCHING FOR A SET OF CONVEX POINTS USING CONVEX HULL AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMAGE SEARCH ALGORITHM

The convex hull of a set X of points in the Euclidean plane is the smallest convex set that contains X. Let P be a set of 2n points in the plane which are in convex position.In this paper we propose to compute in O (n3) time and O(n2) space a bottleneck non-crossing matching of P. We compute the longest edge of bottleneck matching via dynamic programming which has applications in VLSI layout design and operations research. We extend our idea towards several applications of convex hull which includes Pattern matching, gesture recognition and shape based image retrieval. Two more areas of convex hull applications include Terrain building for characterizing geographical surfaces that hold clue to surface of planets like Mars and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) which is a system for capturing and storing data referenced to the Earth .The results shown in this paper illustrate the various applications of convex hull especially on shape based image retrieval and implements the bottleneck non cross matching on a set of convex points in O (n3) time and O(n2) space.
